# git

**Git** is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

* [up_to_date](https://github.com/Jenni-Foued/holbertonschool-zero_day/blob/master/0x03-git/up_to_date): The git command used to be up to date in git with your work on github.
* [.gitignore](https://github.com/Jenni-Foued/holbertonschool-zero_day/blob/master/0x03-git/.gitignore): A **.gitignore** file is a plain text file where each line contains a pattern for files/directories to ignore.

We chose to ignore files appended with a tilde "~"(thoes files are backups created by a text editor or similar program).
